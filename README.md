## What's Diffrent üëÄ
-Easy acces to recognisation.

-High level optimization for commercial uses.

## Overview üñê
Hand-Index-Finger_down-Recogniser can be used to recognise wether the index finger tip is close to the base of index finger.

## How to Use üëÄ

#### 1st argument: Which camera to use (default 0)(computers inbuild camera).

#### 2nd argument: Is that if you want error when camera not opens (default True).

#### 3rd argument: What should be the diffrent values for diffrent distance ranges (default [45, 48.4, 50,8,3.5]).

#### 4th argument: Is that if you want error when hand is too close or far , i.e out of range (default False).
